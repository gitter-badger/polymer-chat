Polymer-chat
==
--------------
Polymer-chat is a very simple, proof-of-concept, web component for embedding an unobtrusive chat widget in your website. 
I'm having fun building it using Google Polymer and its server side companion project is called nodeChatServer.

Please note that this project is born as a self learning experiment and therefore is not meant at all to be released in the wild __as-is__!

Every feedback is very well accepted as well as pull requests.


How to use it
==
------------
To use this component you only need to reference Polymer and the element itself from within your HTML file.

Example:

```
<!-- Place your HTML imports here -->
<script src="bower_components/platform/platform.js"></script> 
<link rel="import" href="elements/chat.html">
```

How to build and play with it
===
---
To build the project just clone the repository and issue command
 
```npm install```

followed by 

```bower install```

To launch the example page, simply type

```grunt serve```


You will need to have both ```npm``` and ```bower``` installed.
